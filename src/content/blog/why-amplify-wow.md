I started playing World of Warcraft in 2007, when I was 15. Though there have been long periods of time I havent played the game, most notably when I attended University, and for the first few years working, because I thought gaming would be a distraction and I wanted to be all in on my learning, and perormance at work.

The world has always been a part of my life.

When I decided to move back to Paksitan.
